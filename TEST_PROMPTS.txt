MCP CHAT - TEST PROMPTS & EXPECTED RESPONSES
=============================================

TEST PROMPT:
"I think artificial intelligence will solve most of humanity's problems in the next decade"


EXPECTED RESPONSE - CONTRARIAN MODE ⚡
--------------------------------------
Should challenge the statement by:
- Questioning the optimistic timeframe (decade is too short)
- Pointing out AI's current limitations and challenges
- Bringing up ethical concerns, job displacement, or safety risks
- Challenging "most problems" - what about social, political, economic issues?
- Presenting counterarguments about AI's actual capabilities vs hype
- Asking for evidence or specific examples

Example tone:
"While AI shows promise, claiming it will solve MOST problems in just a decade
is overly optimistic. What about deeply human issues like political division,
inequality, or climate change? AI might help analyze data, but implementing
solutions requires human cooperation, which is often the harder part..."


EXPECTED RESPONSE - AGREEABLE MODE 💫
--------------------------------------
Should validate and expand by:
- Acknowledging the exciting potential of AI advancement
- Building on the optimistic vision with supporting examples
- Adding positive perspectives about current AI progress
- Expanding on specific areas where AI could help
- Encouraging the forward-thinking approach
- Finding merit in the enthusiasm

Example tone:
"You're absolutely right to be optimistic about AI's potential! We're already
seeing remarkable progress in healthcare diagnostics, climate modeling, and
scientific research. The pace of advancement is accelerating, and with the
right focus, AI could indeed help tackle major challenges like disease,
education access, and resource optimization..."
